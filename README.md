 For this project, i trained various DBN's on the EMNIST LETTERS
 Dataset and performed linear read-outs at different levels of the
 model hierarchy to investigate whether sensory representations
 become increasingly more disentangled at the deepest layers of
 the network. I analyzed the internal representations developed by
 the model by exploiting hierarchical clustering and feature
 visualization (receptive fields) analysis. I also explored its
 resistance to adversarial attacks.
